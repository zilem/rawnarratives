          After completing my very first draft of <i>Sheepwolf,</i> then known as
          <i>Of Meek and Menace,</i> I showed it to close friends to elicit
          feedback. What I learned from long time friend Arlene startled me.
          She observed that,

          She was right. I identified closely with Chye’s struggles as an
          Asian student living in a Western society during my studies overseas.
          His divorce also struck a chord with me. I happened to be going through
          my own divorce during the period I penned the screenplay.

          JUST AS ANG Lee benefited from having his American producer James
          Schamus interpret <i>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon</i> from a
          Westerner’s perspective, I invited Arlene to co-write <i>Sheepwolf.</i>
          This meant restarting the writing from scratch. A complete rewrite.

          Together we strived to create a prestige drama that was more accessible
          to an international audience while developing elements that made it an

          The previous century has seen the Asian male being typecast in

          But showing Asian males in an empowering light shouldn't require
          defaulting to white machismo. More specifically, <i>toxic American
          masculinity.</i> Where the West is about individual over society, Asian
          cultures are about society over individual. The Asian male exposed to
          Western culture is caught between these two states of being. Hence,

          AS WE DELVED deep into Chye’s life in Australia and how that impacted
          his decisions and values after his return to Singapore, it struck me
          that this is a highly relevant film for Asian parents hoping to send
          their children overseas for studies.<br>
          <br>
          Such a film had not been made. Something deep within me was crying out

          <b>Epic</b> because the story spans four decades with consistent themes

          Amidst the chronic anger, fear and betrayal that Chye harboured
          throughout his life, love and a sense of belonging was the Utopia that
          he constantly yearned for. That constantly eluded him every time he
          believes he has found it.<br>
          <br>
          I hope the fact that <i>Sheepwolf</i> is based on a true story gives
          the film the necessary gravitas for audiences to take the social issues
          in the film seriously and to allow themselves to be transformed by it.

          IN THE TWO years that I shadowed Chye, I went through my own separation

          We hope our audience will find it liberating to see being Mr. Mom is
          not a loss of male pride. A man’s dignity is not determined
          by his wife's moral transgressions. A man’s judgment is not compromised
