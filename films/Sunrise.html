        DURING A NIGHT of passionless lovemaking, a nocturnal man and his wife
        repeats the same old fight. She wants kids. He doesn’t. Ever since
        putting his artist career in Singapore on hold to engage in financial
        trading yet failing to yield a sustainable income, he is unwilling to
        focus on his art

          As his trading losses mount, he grows increasingly pessimistic about
          life (in Singapore). And by extension, bringing life into this world.
          They eventually agree to a separation.<br>
          <br>
          Shortly after, he reconnects with an old friend who also suffers from
          a broken marriage. <!--The only difference is that she
          continues to live with her absentee husband for the sake of her 7 year
          old.--> The two confide in their shared pain, igniting dormant
          feelings they have had for one another over the years. As lust fans
          the flames of their passion, she becomes pregnant with his child,
          throwing a spanner in the works. Before they make a decision about
          whether or not to keep the child, she suffers a miscarriage.<br>
          <br>
          Oddly enough, he isn't surprised. He reveals that he belongs to a
          nocturnal species. Which meant the offspring of a human-nocturnal
          union rarely survives. While capable of outliving humans by several
          life times, 
          <!--living half a day everyday is tantamount to the trade-off of being half a human.-->

          migraines and chemo treatments that don’t result in hair loss,
          she appears to be a healthy individual. Which causes him to
          overlook the severity of her condition.<br>

          When her condition worsens and hospital stays become more frequent,
          she requests him to stay by her side at the hospital more often. Even
          during periods when the husband is absent, he is hesitant to be an
          outwardly caring lover.

          After an interminably long hospital stay in which she fails to check
          in with him, he becomes distressed. Upon visiting her, he realizes to

          widely that part of her brain has shut down. Now, he truly regrets

          <i>Nocturnal Sunrise</i> is inspired by the true story of a Singaporean
          male artist who struggles with his masculine instinct of not depending
          on his female partner during times of financial duress. He gives up
          his art to focus his energies on financial trading. To him, time not
          spent generating income or thinking about generating income is a sign
          that he isn’t fulfilling his responsibilities as a man.<br>
          <br>
          Whether such burden of responsibility is self-imposed or a result of
          living in Singapore is arguable. He becomes caught up in proving his
          own self worth via achievements in dollars and cents rather than the
          fulfillment he obtains from his art. In the end, one thing is clear.

          THE NOCTURNAL MAN as protagonist stems from my

          that far from empowering him, burden, trap and imprison him in a
          state of moral, mental and emotional brokenness.<br>
          <br>
          The nocturnal man suffers from an evolutionary blood disorder that
          allows him to live many human life times. Yet his life experiences
          are limited to <b>half</b> a day every day because exposure to sunlight
          destroys him. In a way, he is <i>half a human.</i> So long as he stays
          within his bubble, he gets to live out a sheltered, mundane existence.

          THE MORAL CONUNDRUM of infidelity in the face of a terminal illness
          was what fascinated me most about this story. The guilt the male lover
          experiences toward the husband of the wife he’s having an affair with.
          The greater his love for his lover, the greater his guilt toward the
          husband. Yet how can he withhold love from a dying person?

        <br>
        <p class="para">
          He can be either. But he can’t be both. He leans toward being
          righteous only to regret when circumstances are too dire too late.
          But who’s to say there wouldn’t be worst repercussions if he acted
          less righteously?<br>
          <br>
          There is no moral to this story. I have tried my best to withhold
          judgments on the characters involved. This is intentional. I wrote
          this story primarily for audiences to live vicariously through the
          characters involved in this knotty situation, so that they may form
          their own conclusions and inform their own choices about the future.
