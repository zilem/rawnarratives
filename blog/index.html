        THIS BLOG IS a habit I cultivated as an outlet for the theories and
        opinions that hit me everyday whilst developing my screenplays and characters.<br>
        <br>
        I blog because my characters would prefer I don't do a dialogue dump of
        my ideas on them.<br>
        <br>
        I blog because screenwriting teaches us more than just narratives. Also
        about life & human behaviour.<br>
        <br>
        I blog because it brings clarity to my values and beliefs. And respite
        from screenwriting & filmmaking.

        A COMPELLING MAIN character is a blessing for the writer, the actor, the
        director and the producer. A compelling main character drives the story
        forward in unexpected ways, even with the most insignificant action and
        the subtlest of behaviour. Compelling characters attract talent,
        audiences, investment and awards.

          my characters come ready-made. Nevertheless, the following two methods
          still apply.<br>
          <br>
          After you populate your screenplay with plot and characters, the first
          method involves making <b>keen observations</b> about how your
          characters react to the plot and with other characters.<br>
          <br>
          These observations are not three adjectives that describe the character.
          Or lengthy descriptions involving profession, backstory and family
          background. Certainly not wardrobe preferences either. These are
          helpful. But they do not make for a compelling character. Instead,

          born. Thereafter, he loses his brother to a street murder, prompting
          him to pursue his life’s calling teaching self-defence to empower women.
          He least expects that one day he would have to protect his daughter from her own mother.

          <i>Garage Spacemen</i> is about a maverick scientist Lim Seng who has
          a dream of sending the first Singaporean to space. Despite being a
          prominent former civil servant, his project failed to receive funding
          from Singapore. Undeterred, he amasses a group of volunteers over six
          years to build a spacecraft and to streamline the launch process. With
          help from India and Australia, he manages to launch his manned spacecraft after four attempts.

          rebel who challenges the status quo.)</i><br>
          <br>
          These one-liners form my unique personal take on the characters as a
          filmmaker. They are derived from years of observing my subjects. The
          process is no different for pure fiction screenplays. It’s the gold

          IN SHEEPWOLF, CHYE grows up in a poor abusive family in Singapore
          during the 60s. After marriage, he is determined to give his daughter
          Nicole the loving family he never received as a child. Unfortunately,

          still an infant.<br>

          Not long after, Chye's brother is murdered in a street attack, prompting
          Chye to discover his life’s calling of teaching self-defence to save

          When Nicole turns eight, her mother returns to fight for custody. She

          This is especially important for the Singaporean stories I tell.
          Because a young nation with an unestablished cultural identity has by
          nature a limited built-in audience. Unless the story is written for

          DRAFT ZERO OF the screenplay is what I consider a data dump. An internal
          draft that never gets read by anyone except in the event of my passing.
          It's all about getting the story on the 100+ pages so that it now
          exists as a plot that flows coherently from one event to
          the next whilst engaging the reader’s emotions.<br>
          <br>
          Following that, I shelve Draft Zero for a month.

          The deeper psychological motivations of why the writer is telling the

          Statement</i> - a document used to clarify to myself and others about
          why I’m telling the story. <br>
          <br>
          With my <i>why</i> in mind, I revisit Draft Zero. And perhaps discard
          a third of it. Some writers find this an inefficient process. I
          believe it makes for a <b>strong</b> story. By strong, I don’t mean
          tight. A tight story is one that doesn’t meander and keeps
          the audience constantly entertained.

          This is not to be confused with auteur-driven films where the style of

          A strong story’s primary purpose is to serve the audience.<br>
          <br>
          As I assemble the next draft, I go back to interview the subjects for
          perspectives that oppose my <i>why.</i> It’s equally important to test
          my <i>why</i> and not merely seek confirmation bias. This is the
          Hegelian dialectic, <i>thesis-antithesis-synthesis</i> at work.<br>

          In <a href="//films.rawnarrativ.es/Spacemen.html" style="color:inherit"><i>Garage Spacemen,</i></a>
          my <i>why</i> is to inspire audiences to take action on their dreams
          no matter how outlandish they seem. Yet despite overwhelming perseverance,
          the space endeavor never succeeded. The moral of the story is <b>not</b>
          <i>if you take action on your dreams, you would eventually succeed.</i>
          It’s tempting for the filmmaker to be lulled into this false
          sense of security and tell the conventional <i>“motivational tale”.</i>
          But such a tale simply isn’t true of life.<br>

          version to get a co-writer onboard.<br>
          <br>
          Getting a co-writer involved at this stage is not the norm for an indie
          feature. Few writers are willing to share credit or relinquish creative
          control after this much work has been put into the screenplay. But

          For that, I usually involve a co-writer with a similar <i>why</i> but
          who comes from a different culture as the one the story is set in.
          This provides a perspective that I’m unaware of, thereby improving how
          the story will be received by other cultures.<br>
          <br>
          In the case of <a href="//films.rawnarrativ.es/Sheepwolf.html" style="color:inherit"><i>Sheepwolf,</i></a>
          my American co-writer Arlene provided the Western female perspective
          that I was largely oblivious to on a story about an Asian male protagonist.
          I likened our working relationship to the one that director Ang Lee
          had with his writer-producer James Schamus on <i>Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.</i>
          As the Chinese screenplay was being written in Taiwan, Lee would
          translate it into English and email it to Schamus in New York every
          night. By the following morning, Lee would receive the revised version
          from Schamus and translate it to Chinese. I believe this rigorous
          process helped garner its Oscar nomination for Best Screenplay.

          DRAFT TWO OF the screenplay is the product of co-writing. In the case
          of <i>Sheepwolf,</i> a complete rewrite that took Arlene and I two years.<br>

          This draft would be sent to labs and producers for funding and
          hopefully, production. More changes are expected along the way. Some
          minor, some major. Until the project is green-lit and the screenplay
          makes its way to the shooting script  - the Final Draft. <i>Which may
          take an additional year. Maybe longer. Maybe never.</i><br>
          <br>
          I’ve once had the opposite experience of rushing into making a feature
          film. It took me a year to complete. But I spent a lifetime being
          dissatisfied with it. Life is much too long to indulge the ego's need
          for short term gratification.<br>
          <br>
          These days, a screenplay can easily take me three to five years to get

              DID YOU KNOW that <b>two</b> Roman empires co-existed at one point?<br>
              <br>
              By the 3rd century, the Roman Empire had grown so vast that emperor
              Diocletian recognized it wasn’t feasible to govern from Rome. So
              in 286, he divided the empire into two halves with the
              <!--Eastern Empire’s capital at Byzantium, later renamed
              Constantinople in 330 (modern day Istanbul) and the Western Empire
              governed from Milan with Rome as the ceremonial capital. The-->
              border between the two empires corresponding roughly with that
              separating modern day Eastern and Western Europe.<br>
              <br>
              While the Eastern Empire flourished, the Western Empire languished,
              eventually falling in 476 at the hands of the barbarian statesman
              Odoacer who deposed Romulus Augustulus, the last Roman emperor to
              rule the Western Empire. With the empire fallen, Western Europe
              continued to exist for the following centuries as numerous tribal
              kingdoms - Franks, Visigoths, Vandals, etc. Not long after, the
              Eastern Emperor Zeno dissolved the Western court and proclaimed
              himself the sole emperor of the Roman Empire.<br>

              <!--In 480, four years after the fall of the Western Empire,  Then-->
              In 797, Irene of Athens, mother of then Emperor Constantine VI,
              gouged out her son’s eyes, leading to his death. She would then
              proclaim herself the sole ruler of the Roman Empire as she
              continued to rule from Constantinople (modern day Istanbul).<br>
              <br>
              The unprecedented status of a female ruler led Pope Leo III in Rome to
              crown the Frankish king Charlemagne as <i>“Emperor of the Romans”</i>
              in an attempt to revive the Western Roman Empire. In 800, a new
              empire in Western Europe emerged. The Holy Roman Empire. A name
              that overshadows its eastern counterpart, henceforth known as the
              Byzantine Empire.

              When an individual other than the church anoints someone, it does not

              and legitimacy when you can show their <i>endorsement</i> of you.
              Opportunists like Charlemagne go so far as to create their own

              emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.<br>
              <br>
              On the other hand, because the nature of <b>Church</b> is symbolic

              <br>
              Therefore Krueger believes that instead of writing for the market,
              emerging screenwriters should focus on telling stories from the heart.
              Writing that connects with their instincts. Their identity. Their

              On the other hand, the pursuit of happiness as an end is like a
              fix. The same experience. Over and over again. When numb, simply

              <br>
              Because activities involving the sole pursuit of happiness are
              intrinsically <i>empty and meaningless,</i> it serves as a

              ACHIEVEMENT IS OFTEN confused with fulfillment. They bear similar
              traits. Both are enduring. But the intent is different.<br>
              <br>
              A multi-millionaire friend who devoted his life to an incredibly
              meaningful cause revealed to me once that he wanted to help his
              daughter increase her real estate portfolio from $6 million to
              $8 million. He believed that the <i>sense of achievement</i> would
              give her the confidence she needs in life.<br>
              <br>
              This struck me as ironic and bizarre. Unlike immutable laws of
              physics, doesn't it sound ludicrous that an arbitary figure such
              as an additional $2 million can give you the confidence you need?
              Yet how many of us have a similar practice of keeping our own
              arbitrary figures in our heads that would meet some peculiar need?
              I know one who believed that she should be compensated $1
              million by her employer before she can leave her job to relocate
              overseas. What's the rationale?

        THERE WAS A time when my life revolved around crewing on film sets. The
        love for filmmaking started out with the act of making films.<br>
        <br>
        <i>I figured out <b>what</b> I was passionate about.</i>

          As the years passed, I realized that filmmaking was about storytelling.
          And it all began, ironically, outside the film set. In the writer’s
          seat.<br>
          <br>
          <i>I figured out <b>how</b> to go about fulfilling what I was
            passionate about.</i><br>
          <br>
          After making a few films and not totally loving it, it occurred to me
          that it didn’t matter if I could write and direct well. I was given a
          megaphone but I had no voice.<br>

          I was adamant that if I had to give up something, it was my

          At the turning point of my life, it hit me hard when I lost someone close

          with the implication that their skills will help the company. Which
          explains why she was thoroughly impressed when Lori Goler who applied
          to work at Facebook asked the million dollar question, <i>“What is

            Take a moment to imagine that you’re having a conversation with
            someone you potentially want to work or collaborate with. The first
            question you want to be <b>listening</b> for is <i>“What’s your
            biggest problem?”</i> or <i>“What’s your biggest aspiration?”</i><br>
            <br>
            Have this question at the back of your mind. The answer would surface
            naturally during the conversation. By listening for the other person’s
            biggest problem or biggest aspiration, you now possess the key to
            <b>unlock value</b> for this person. Why is this important? Because…

            Framing is asking yourself the second question, <i>“How can I
            <b>help</b> to solve it?”</i> or <i>“How can I <b>help</b> you attain it?”</i>
            The difference between this version and Goler’s is the word <i>help.</i>
            Because it’s rarely likely that you have the relevant skill sets to

        DO YOU HAVE 5 people in your life you can turn to, <b>whose perspectives

      <p class="para collapse" id="collapseWizards" aria-expanded="false">
        Are your 5 wizards <i>wired differently enough</i> from you, and from
        one another, such that their perspectives work in concert to illuminate
        your blind spots <b>holistically?</b><br>
        <br>
        Wizards <i>don't</i> have to be mentors or coaches. But they
        <b>shouldn't</b> be your father figure. You want a distinctive voice
        you trust. <i>Not the default voice you revere.</i> For some, their
        children are their wizards.<br>
        <br>
        Wizarding, unlike mentoring or coaching, is a two way street. <i>You can
        be a wizard to someone who's your wizard.</i> It's not about getting
        advice from a sage. Not about obtaining consensus. It's about variety.
        Because <i>variety induces holism.</i><br>
        <br>
        Who you choose to be your wizards is absolutely critical. So limit
        those voices to 5. Most would have trouble identifying 3. View each
        crisis as an opportunity to reinvent yourself when you consult your
        wizards, and when you are <i>someone else's</i> wizard. The desired
        outcome is <b>a lighter, enlightened mind.</b><br>

          Judgmental behaviour, as the term implies, doesn’t have to be verbal.
          It doesn’t even require the subject to be present. In fact, judgments

        A TITLE IS like a movie trailer. Instead of two minutes you have <b>one

          STRICTLY SPEAKING, <i>“AMBASSADOR”</i> refers to a diplomatic official

          familiar to your audience that it fails to capture anyone's attention.<br>
          <br>
          On the other hand, your audience probably understands <i>“ambassador”</i>
          to mean someone so fervently supportive of you that they'd readily
          recommend you to friends and family. C'mon, there's no denying it
          sounds way more <b>sexy, compelling and dramatic</b> than the other two.<br>

          By now, your title should have hooked your audience in under a second.
          Why bother with <b>authenticity?</b><br>

          Imagine being lured to a movie that doesn’t feel like what
          you've experienced in the trailer. The same thing applies for a title.

        MEDITATIVE SCREENWRITING TEACHER Jessica Hinds introduced the concept of

        <b>Validation</b> - <i>to prove to yourself</i><br>

          Emotional needs are not tied to the nature of the action. <i>It's not
          about <b>what</b> you're doing but <b>why</b> you're doing what you're
          doing.</i><br>
          <br>
          If you're climbing Mount Everest, most would assume it’s for
          validation. That maybe true for most cases. Though you could be
          climbing Mount Everest for any of the following reasons:
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>To challenge yourself</i> - <b>Validation</b><br>
          <i>To gain the respect of others</i> - <b>Respect</b><br>
          <i>To champion a cause</i> - <b>Justice</b><br>
          <i>To be with your spouse</i> - <b>Love</b><br>
          <i>To be amongst friends</i> - <b>Comfort</b><br>
        </p>
        <p class="para">
          Some actions have up to three underlying emotional needs but one stands
          out as dominant.

          My primary emotional need in life began with <b>Respect</b> till my

        PERHAPS THE MOST significant element in all great films that touch, move

          To see this powerful concept executed in screenwriting, a highly driven
          character (e.g. an entrepreneur) begins his journey with an objective -
          a notion of what he <b><i>wants.</i></b> He is undeterred from his
          goal. The audience roots for him because of his determination.<br>
          <br>
          By the end of his journey, he arrives at an <i>unexpected yet
          inevitable</i> conclusion that what he <b><i>wants</i></b> no longer
          matters. Instead he discovers what he <b><i>needs.</i></b> Usually
          something that fills an obvious emotional void. This bitter-sweet
          moment can be so unforgettable for the audience that it has the
          capacity to change lives.

          HERE'S A TRUE story. I was working on the screenplays of two
          <a href="//rawnarrativ.es/#TrueStories" style="color:inherit">true stories</a>
          that ignite the
          <a href="//rawnarrativ.es/#HumanSpirit" style="color:inherit">human spirit</a>
          when I found out that my partner was stricken with terminal cancer.
          It was a rare form of cancer that showed few external signs of
          debilitation. I took it for granted that she had a few more years.<br>
          <br>
          Given the extreme difficulties of getting a film produced, I plowed
          on my screenplay tirelessly, prioritizing art over love. Despite her
          pleas, I took off for a month to co-write with my writing partner in
          Los Angeles.<br>
          <br>
          When I returned, I was shocked to find her body muscles have atrophied
          beyond belief. Her condition declined rapidly thereafter. In a few
          months, I was overcame with shock when she could no longer recognise
          me. Shortly after, she passed on.<br>
          <br>
          <i>Could I not have waited a year to make my trip to LA?</i><br>
          <br>
          Unfortunately that was all hindsight. What I <b><i>wanted</i></b>
          badly was to complete my screenplay. Call it Art. Ambition.
          Achievement. What I <b><i>needed</i></b> most was compassion.
          Regrettably, I learnt it the hard way and bore the brunt of a painful,
          irreversible transformation.<br>

          <br>
          <i>Apple</i> and <i>Virgin</i> are grounded in their <b>cause</b> of

          If we consider <i>Apple</i> and <i>Virgin</i> as disruptors, we need to

          2018. Moved by his intention to inspire the next generation of
          Singaporeans to <i><b>take action</b></i> on their dreams, I came onboard

          His first attempt to launch a manned flight to space was on 15 May 2018
          from Alice Springs, Australia.<br>
          <br>
          In the days leading to the launch, Singapore’s first astronaut was
          revealed. Volunteers along with their family members and a news crew
          from Singapore showed up in the remote desert to show their support.
          Unfortunately, winter came early that year. Winds were too strong for
          a safe liftoff. Everyone went home with a heavy heart when <i>we
          failed to launch.</i> <br>
          <br>
          A year later, the team of volunteers and news crew reconvened in Alice
          Springs for the second attempt on 26 April 2019. Only this time, the
          team was smaller. Weather conditions were favourable leading up to the
          launch date. But owing to malfunctioning navigation equipment,
          once again, <i>we failed to launch.</i><br>

          CONSIDERING THE CONSEQUENCE of failure for most startups rarely
          places a human’s life in harm’s way, Lim Seng has been rightfully
          prudent for safety reasons. However, patience was running thin amongst
          his volunteers. With two failed attempts to launch and social media
          deriding it as a scam, the <b><i>raison d'être</i></b> of the project
          and his credibility as <b><i>a man of action</i></b> were now being tested.<br>

          As it turns out, <i>safety</i> in a rarely attempted endeavour such as
          this can be a constant moving target. Within a fortnight, Lim Seng
          rallied his troops with the promise that he would launch on 31 May 2019.
          Earnestly reaching out to every volunteer, he assembled a skeletal
          crew of nine for his third attempt. I was one of them, assigned to
          play an integral role in operations.<br>
          <br>
          A day prior to the launch, Lim Seng announced the inevitable. Given
          the risks involved, the most responsible course of action as campaign
          director was for him, the man who funded the venture and who engineered
          the spacecraft, to assume the role of astronaut provided he deemed it
          <i>safe enough</i> for launch. To him, it was. Finally,<br>

          AS THE LAUNCH kicked into high gear, unlike previous unmanned launches,

        HAVING WORKED WITH several co-writers and developers from the US and UK,

          Based on a <a href="//rawnarrativ.es/#TrueStories" style="color:inherit">true story</a>
          that took place in Singapore, <i>Sheepwolf</i> is about a man, Chye,
          who after his brother's street murder, discovers his life’s calling,
          founding Asia’s largest self-defence movement to empower women, least
          expecting the day he would save his daughter from her own mother.<br>
          <br>
          Arlene is a first generation American writer-director based in Los
          Angeles. Because her mother survived WWII and the Gulag camps in
          Siberia before migrating to America, the theme of survival in
          <i>Sheepwolf</i> resonated with her.<br>
          <br>
          I invited Arlene to co-write <i>Sheepwolf</i> because I knew her to
          be an ardent supporter of women’s interests. A story about female
          empowerment via self-defence could benefit greatly from her voice.
          Together we explored themes of abuse and racism, using Chye’s
          experiences in 1980s Australia to critique the toxic masculine culture
          prevalent in contemporary American society.

          BECAUSE I KNOW Chye well in person, there’s always a subconscious
          impulse to favour an accurate portrayal of his character over being
          authentic to the spirit of the story.<br>
          <br>
          Chye had one personality anomaly I was particularly drawn to. On the one
          hand, he made it his life’s mission to empower women. On the other,
          as a result of his acrimonious divorce, he developed a mistrust for
          women when it came to romance. Arlene was adamant about not showing
          Chye’s misogynistic side. It seemed bizarre to me that

          A role that actors would die for. The more I justified my grounds, the
          more Arlene felt that I wasn’t being sensitive towards the female
          audience. That she would have no part to play in a film that promoted
          misogyny.<br>
          <br>
          In that moment, her reaction reminded me of how offensive Mickey
          Rooney’s caricatural portrayal of Mr. Yunioshi was in the famous
          1961 film <i>Breakfast at Tiffany’s.</i><br>

          It struck me then that to unintentionally include misogynistic
          references in <i>Sheepwolf</i> would be as offensive as “yellowface”
          -  a controversial Hollywood tradition of casting white actors as Asians.
          Both were discrimination.

          Most importantly, just as <i>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</i> is not a film
          about racism, <i>Sheepwolf</i> is not a film about misogyny. It's a
          film about survival. In serving that theme, we've chosen to <b>selectively
          idealize</b> the main character.<br>

        AFTER CHECKING OUT many customized picture frames in a mall that
        specializes in custom frames, my girlfriend and I came across the only
        store that sold ready-made ones. Impressed by their quaint artistic
        decor, fast turnaround and premium-looking frames that cost a fraction
        of their custom cousins, we paid them to reprint and frame our pictures.
        Walking away with what seemed like a great deal, we returned an hour
        later for collection of the finished product. Whereupon I noticed to my
        dismay, one of their ready-made frames had an IKEA product tag.<br>

      <font color="#c5000b">

        <p class="para">
          I singled out the framer and demanded to know if the frames we bought
          were from IKEA. Caught by surprise, he looked at the manager. Then
          claimed he wasn’t aware since it was the boss who got them. Meanwhile,
          my girlfriend looked up IKEA’s website and asked to reconfirm the size
          of the frame we paid for. The room went silent. Tension mounted as
          they saw us learn of the vast difference we overpaid.<br>
          <br>
          In a desperate attempt to contain the situation, the manager promptly
          volunteered to refund our payment for the frames. Which did little to
          placate my nerves. She later reflected the owner’s views, who
          justified that it was normal business practice to mark up items in
          order to cover operating expenses. Which I do <i>not</i> disagree. But
          that was never the point. In fact, <i>never</i> once did I mention I
          was overcharged or that I wanted my money back.

          Integrity is subjective. Nevertheless, if the integrity of what you

        DURING MY TRAINING as an architecture student at Cooper Union, I was
        privileged to have world renowned architects as professors. I admired
        their strong personalities, their ability to bulldoze their opinions
        through critiques such that lesser professors constantly deferred
        politically to the top dog. As top dog, their outsized egos allowed
        them to
        <!--, we had to verbally defend
        our ideas during grueling critiques. You would imagine that <i>having an
        opinion</i> about why you do the things you do matter in this regard.<br>
        <br>
        But when your professors are renowned architects with supersized egos,
        you quickly realize that your opinion doesn’t count. These professors had
        strong personalities and were never shy of speaking their minds.-->

          To the impressionable twenty year old, it appeared that possessing an
          ego that left little room for others to voice their opinions were the
          hallmarks of a successful architect. But

          I USED TO think that being critical and judgmental was a sign that I

          discover later that it's an issue. Though not the strong personality
          per se. It's
          <!--especially if these views were emotionally charged (i.e. elicit an
          emotional reaction). After all, as an indie filmmaker, wasn't I

          Unfortunately, an impasse is when both parties enter defensive mode to
          protect their egos, making it hard to consider other possibilities.
          Possibilities proposed by strong personalities because they are viewed
          as authoritarians. Possibilities proposed by not-so-strong

          When you express curiosity or summarize what the other person has just said,
          you're giving them feedback on how their ideas are interpreted on the

          More importantly, you're letting them know that you're <i>listening.</i>
          That they are <b>heard.</b> And that's what a good listener does.

            Psychologist Russ Harris created a simple exercise for us to

            <br>
            Imagine you are 80 years old (or pick an older age if you’re

            EVER SINCE MY disillusionment and departure from a corporate world

            <i>achievement,</i> but not a sense of <i>fulfillment.</i> Not until

            Film festivals, with their awards and recognition, celebrate the

            For instance, he wanted to become a <i>New York Times</i> bestseller.
            What he believed were important steps such as going to writers’
            conferences, reading a lot about writing, conducting focus groups,
            having media coverage or having famous people endorse his book,
            <i>all didn’t matter.</i><br>
            <br>
            Instead, he found out that all that mattered to become a <i>New York

            <br>
            Using this method, he apparently took his book <i>The Millionaire

            In <i>Destructive Goal Pursuit: The Mount Everest Disaster,</i>

            <b>identity.</b> When presented with information that showed
            uncertainty about achieving their goals, it only made the climbers
            invest even more fiercely in their preferred vision of their future.
            In this desperate attempt to preserve their sense of identity, some
            end up losing their lives.<br>
            <br>
            To disregard this example because the rest of us pursue goals that
            are of much lower stakes would be missing the point. The nugget of

            This is not an attempt to appear humble or to avoid setting high
            expectations in case I fail to reach them. I do recognize the value
            that <a href="#Church" style="color:inherit">recognition</a>
            (by major film festivals) brings to my career. It’s just that I
            don’t see my feature films
            <a href="//films.rawnarrativ.es/Sheepwolf.html" style="color:inherit"><i>Sheepwolf</i></a> and
            <a href="//films.rawnarrativ.es/Spacemen.html" style="color:inherit"><i>Garage Spacemen</i></a>
            to be a celebration of my ego. Rather recognition is there to <i>serve</i>
            my desire to move and inspire my intended audience to a higher cause.<br>
            <br>
            After defining my life goal, I come up with my 5 moves, as follows:<br>
            <br>
            <i>1. Develop my <b>worldview</b> by reading & blogging.<br>
              2. Develop my <b>craft</b> by watching films.<br>
              3. <b>Rewrite</b> screenplay until satisfied.<br>
              4. Create <b>marketing</b> materials.<br>
              5. <b>Reach out</b> to festival labs & producers.</i><br>
            <br>
            The first three are intrinsic goals. The last two are extrinsic.
            Prioritizing my goals allows me to enjoy my work and feel fulfilled
            in the present, rather than postpone my happiness to five years in
            the future.<br>
            <br>
            And if someone were to ask me, <i>"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"</i>
            I'll be exactly <i>where</i> I am <i>today</i>, feeling <b>fulfilled</b>
            knowing I'm

            Because I believe that meaning in life is not obtained from seeking
            achievement or happiness but in fulfillment. And <i><b>fulfillment</b>

            Some may notice that it seems odd that the steps of actually making
            the film are left out. Admittedly, making a film consists of a lot
            of moving parts often outside my control. These 5 moves ensure
            that I at least get my vision on paper to the best of my abilities.
