        This blog is a habit I cultivated as an outlet for the opinions and

        my characters don't want to be burdened with a dialogue dump of my ideas.
        I blog because it gives me an excuse not to work on my screenplays. I
        blog because it brings greater clarity to my values and beliefs.

        THERE WAS A time when my life revolved around crewing on film sets. The
        love for filmmaking started out with the act of making films.<br>
        <br>
        <i>I figured out <b>what</b> I was passionate about.</i>
      </p>

      <div class="collapse" id="collapseDiscoverWhy" aria-expanded="false">
        <p class="para">
          As the years passed, I realized that filmmaking was about storytelling.
          And it all began, ironically, outside the film set. In the writer’s
          seat.<br>
          <br>
          <i>I figured out <b>how</b> to go about fulfilling what I was
            passionate about.</i><br>
          <br>
          After making a few films and not totally loving it, it occurred to me
          that it didn’t matter if I could write and direct well. I was given a
          megaphone but I had no voice.<br>
          <br>
          <i>I couldn’t figure out <b>why</b> I was making films. I didn't know
            my raison d’être.</i>

        <p class="firstpara">
          BEFORE FILM, I had given up on many things in life. Somehow, I
          couldn't seem to give up on film. Film was my art. <i>Art was my
          cause.</i> Serving that cause gave my life meaning.<br>
          <br>
          I was adamant that if I had to give up something, it was my
          relationships, including my marriage, in service of my art.<br>
          <br>
          At the turning point of my life, it hit me hard when I lost someone close
          to cancer. It struck me then that it wasn't about giving up anything.
          It was simply about giving. <i>Giving more of myself.</i><br>
          <br>
          I found <i>clarity in my <b>why.</b></i>

          FACEBOOK COO SHERYL Sandberg shares in her book <i>Lean In</i> that
          most people are preoccupied with finding the right role for themselves,
          with the implication that their skills will help the company. Which
          explains why she was thoroughly impressed when Lori Goler who applied
          to work at Facebook asked the million dollar question, <i>“What is
          your biggest problem, and how can I solve it?”</i>

            Take a moment to imagine that you’re having a conversation with
            someone you potentially want to work or collaborate with. The first
            question you want to be <b>listening</b> for is <i>“What’s your
            biggest problem?”</i> or <i>“What’s your biggest aspiration?”</i><br>
            <br>
            Have this question at the back of your mind. The answer would surface
            naturally during the conversation. By listening for the other party’s
            biggest problem or biggest aspiration, you now possess the key to
            <b>unlock value</b> for this person. Why is this important? Because…

            Framing is asking yourself the second question, <i>“How can I

            The difference between this version and Goler’s is the word <i>help.</i>
            Because it’s rarely likely that you have the relevant skill sets to

        DO YOU HAVE 5 people in your life you can turn to, <b>whose perspectives
        you value,</b> within 48 hours of encountering a crisis?
      <p>

      <p class="para collapse" id="collapseWizards" aria-expanded="false">
        Are your 5 wizards <i>wired differently enough</i> from you, and from
        one another, such that their perspectives work in concert to illuminate
        your blind spots <b>holistically?</b><br>
        <br>
        Wizards <i>don't</i> have to be mentors or coaches. But they
        <b>shouldn't</b> be your father figure. You want a distinctive voice
        you trust. <i>Not the default voice you revere.</i> For some, their
        children are their wizards.<br>
        <br>
        Wizarding, unlike mentoring or coaching, is a two way street. <i>You can
        be a wizard to someone who's your wizard.</i> It's not about getting
        advice from a sage. Not about obtaining consensus. It's about variety.
        Because <i>variety induces holism.</i><br>
        <br>
        Who you choose to be your wizards is absolutely critical. So limit
        those voices to 5. Most would have trouble identifying 3. View each
        crisis as an opportunity to reinvent yourself when you consult your
        wizards, and when you are <i>someone else's</i> wizard. The desired
        outcome is <b>a lighter, enlightened mind.</b><br>

        CONSIDER THE SCENARIO in which <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> hit it off within
        two dates. The heightened connection experienced within a short timeframe
        causes them to attribute the magic to <i>“chemistry.”</i> They assume
        chemistry is a reliable indicator of long-term compatibility and they
        rush into a committed relationship.<br>
        <br>
        Shortly after, <i>A</i> deluges <i>B</i> with texts. <i>A</i> believes
        baring the soul is an act of authenticity. <i>A</i> even guilt-trips
        <i>B</i> for acting guarded and aloof. Confused, <i>B</i> sees <i>A</i>
        as needy. Friends advise <i>A</i> to text less and <i>"play the game."</i>
        At best, the relationship crashes and burns. At worst, it drags

          Emotional needs are not tied to the nature of the action. <i>It's not

          If you're climbing Mount Everest, most would assume it’s for
          validation. That maybe true for most cases. Though you could be
          climbing Mount Everest for any of the following reasons:
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>To challenge yourself</i> - <b>Validation</b><br>
          <i>To gain the respect of others</i> - <b>Respect</b><br>
          <i>To champion a cause</i> - <b>Justice</b><br>
          <i>To be with your spouse</i> - <b>Love</b><br>
          <i>To be amongst friends</i> - <b>Comfort</b><br>

          To see this powerful concept executed in screenwriting, a highly driven

          Given the extreme difficulties of getting a film produced, I plowed

          months, I was overcame with shock when she could no longer recognize
          me. Shortly after, she passed on.<br>

          BEING A DISRUPTOR is fashionable these days. But there's no

          what the industry <b>is not.</b><br>
          <br>
          <i>Apple</i> & <i>Virgin</i> are commonly referred to as lifestyle

          out of business. <i>Apple</i> & <i>Virgin</i> don’t.<br>
          <br>
          <i>Apple</i> & <i>Virgin</i> are grounded in their <b>cause</b> of
          challenging the status quo. Differentiation from their competitors is
          a result. Not a motivation. Beauty and innovation is an outcome. Not
          an impetus.<br>
          <br>
          If we consider <i>Apple</i> & <i>Virgin</i> as disruptors, we need to
          ask how many markets have they upended? Like a vigilante, a disruptor
          can be ignored.<br>
          <br>
          <i>Apple</i> & <i>Virgin</i> however, are <b>movements beyond a brand.</b>
          Their identities are moulded by a higher cause. Their achievements are

          I BEGAN COVERING Lim Seng's story as an independent filmmaker in early
          2018. Moved by his intention to inspire the next generation of
          Singaporeans to <i><b>take action</b></i> on their dreams, I came onboard
          <a href="//probono.rawnarrativ.es" style="color:inherit">pro bono</a> as

          His first attempt to launch a manned flight to space was on 15 May 2018
          from Alice Springs, Australia.<br>
          <br>
          In the days leading to the launch, Singapore’s first astronaut was
          revealed. Volunteers along with their family members and a news crew
          from Singapore showed up in the remote desert to show their support.
          Unfortunately, winter came early that year. Winds were too strong for
          a safe liftoff. Everyone went home with a heavy heart when <i>we
          failed to launch.</i> <br>
          <br>
          A year later, the team of volunteers and news crew reconvened in Alice
          Springs for the second attempt on 26 April 2019. Only this time, the
          team was smaller. Weather conditions were favourable leading up to the
          launch date. But owing to malfunctioning navigation equipment,
          once again, <i>we failed to launch.</i><br>

          CONSIDERING THE CONSEQUENCE of failure for most startups rarely
          places a human’s life in harm’s way, Lim Seng has been rightfully
          prudent for safety reasons. However, patience was running thin amongst
          his volunteers. With two failed attempts to launch and social media
          deriding it as a scam, the <b><i>raison d'être</i></b> of the project
          and his credibility as <b><i>a man of action</i></b> were now being tested.<br>

          As it turns out, <i>safety</i> in a rarely attempted endeavour such as
          this can be a constant moving target. Within a fortnight, Lim Seng
          rallied his troops with the promise that he would launch on 31 May 2019.
          Earnestly reaching out to every volunteer, he assembled a skeletal
          crew of nine for his third attempt. I was one of them, assigned to
          play an integral role in operations.<br>
          <br>
          A day prior to the launch, Lim Seng announced the inevitable. Given
          the risks involved, the most responsible course of action as campaign
          director was for him, the man who funded the venture and who engineered
          the spacecraft, to assume the role of astronaut provided he deemed it
          <i>safe enough</i> for launch. To him, it was. Finally,<br>

          AS THE LAUNCH kicked into high gear, unlike previous unmanned launches,
          every action from inflating the stratospheric ballon to stabilizing the
          spacecraft had tremendous consequence if gone wrong. <i>Simply because
          the stakes were so bloody high.</i> The payload wasn't a piece of test
          equipment. It was a living breathing human being! Who must return to

          <br>
          Murphy’s law <i>“anything can go wrong will go wrong”</i> interfered

          <br>
          No one on the ground had an inkling if Lim Seng was alive for two
          harrowing hours since liftoff till search & rescue found him intact

          IN SEASON 1, Jaime Lannister is being introduced as the villain knight
          in shining armor who is caught in an incestuous act with his sister by a
          ten year old. Jaime pushes the boy from the window, crippling him
          for the rest of his life.<br>
          <br>
          A few episodes later, Jaime’s overbearing father berates Jaime for the
          shame he's harboured years after slaying the king he was sworn to
          protect. Jaime experiences brief moments of disillusionment about the
          notion of honour he’s meant to uphold as a knight.<br>
          <br>
          Throughout season 2 whilst being captured as a prisoner of war, Jaime
          sacrifices his cousin’s life in his attempts to escape. In the face
          of death, he continues to display malice, depravity and brutality -
          traits of the ultimate irredeemable character.<br>
          <br>
          After spending two seasons with Jaime Lannister, this is clearly
          someone who despite many life-changing experiences, including an
          interesting kingslaying <b>story,</b> remains largely a cardboard villain.<br>

          strives to act more honorably, and would go on to become a character

          who after his brother's street murder, discovers his life’s calling,
          founding Asia’s largest self-defence movement to empower women, least
          expecting the day he would save his daughter from her own mother.<br>
          <br>
          Arlene is a first generation American writer-director based in Los
          Angeles. Because her mother survived WWII and the Gulag camps in
          Siberia before migrating to America, the theme of survival in
          <i>Sheepwolf</i> resonated with her.<br>
          <br>
          I invited Arlene to co-write <i>Sheepwolf</i> because I knew her to
          be an ardent supporter of women’s interests. A story about female
          empowerment via self-defence could benefit greatly from her voice.
          Together we explored themes of abuse and racism, using Chye’s
          experiences in 1980s Australia to critique the toxic masculine culture
          prevalent in contemporary American society.

          BECAUSE I KNOW Chye well in person, there’s always a subconscious

          authentic to the spirit of the story.<br>
          <br>
          Chye had one personality anomaly I was particularly drawn to. On the one
          hand, he made it his life’s mission to empower women. On the other,
          as a result of his acrimonious divorce, he developed a mistrust for
          women when it came to romance. Arlene was adamant about not showing

          A role that actors would die for. The more I justified my grounds, the
          more Arlene felt that I wasn’t being sensitive towards the female
          audience. That she would have no part to play in a film that promoted
          misogyny.<br>
          <br>
          In that moment, her reaction reminded me of how offensive Mickey
          Rooney’s caricatural portrayal of Mr. Yunioshi was in the famous
          1961 film <i>Breakfast at Tiffany’s.</i><br>

        IN SIR THOMAS More's 1516 socio-political satire <i>Utopia,</i> the
        eponymous fictional state is painted as a place of perfection in law and
        order. In Utopia, possession of gold is frowned upon, going so far as
        featuring prisoners <i>bound in fetters of gold.</i> In Singapore’s
        quest for Utopia, this is what Singaporeans have become.<br>

          The unquestionable priority for the average 30 year old Singaporean is
          to purchase property. Because ownership of property is widely perceived
          as the safest form of preserving one’s nest egg. Property has become the
          default choice of parking one’s money. Property has become <i>"silos
          of wealth."</i> Extrapolating this phenomena in land scarce Singapore
          inevitably leads the country to be in danger of becoming <b>a nation
          of landlords.</b> Not surprisingly,

          We choose safety investing in property over funding innovation out of FOMO.</h6>
        </font>
        <p class="para">
          Recognizing this, the government taxes ownership of additional properties.
          Being the nation’s largest land banker, it controls the supply of its
          leasehold land. Apart from a meager 17% freehold land, most properties
          are 99 years leasehold. This antiquated legacy of British colonial
          rule points to a painful truth. <b>Most of us never truly own our
          properties.</b><br>
          <br>
          Imagine 6 to 7 digits of hard-earned dollars evaporating in less than a
          century! This would be unthinkable in some countries. Even if it
          isn't, is this system fair? Is this system just?

          Every investment savvy Singaporean has learned to be obstinately
          pragmatic. Two commonly asked questions when purchasing property are,
          <i>Is it freehold? What’s the psf (per square foot price)?</i> Because
          every square foot counts. Including the ledge that the A/C compressor
          sits on! This unhealthy obsession on the property’s tenure and its psf
          has a deleterious effect on its people.

          And this is the price we pay for safety. For Singapore is indeed the
          safest country in the world to live in. If capitalism is the efficient
          allocation of resources, by channelling our capital increasingly into
          "silos of wealth", how are we producing anything meaningful to society?
          For a ‘smart nation’ that prides itself on innovation, we are indeed
          pragmatically oppressed. We have indeed become <i>imprisoned by our own
          fetters of gold.</i>

        <!--But <i>is a shackled mind a safe one to live in?</i><br>

        WHAT HAPPENS WHEN those with the power to say no, lack the balls to say yes to true innovation?
        For all that Singapore prides itself on innovation, is it destined
        to become a 'smart nation' of landlords, materialists & conformists?
        Pragmatism is the modern day shackles we must break free of. We need
        role models who champion ideals & autonomy.-->

        Never betray what you stand for.</h6>

      <p class="firstpara">
        AFTER CHECKING OUT many customized picture frames in a mall that
        specializes in custom frames, my girlfriend and I came across the only
        store that sold ready-made ones. Impressed by their quaint artistic
        decor, fast turnaround and premium-looking frames that cost a fraction
        of their custom cousins, we paid them to reprint and frame our pictures.
        Walking away with what seemed like a great deal, we returned an hour
        later for collection of the finished product. Whereupon I noticed to my
        dismay, one of their ready-made frames had an IKEA product tag.<br>
      </p>
      <font color="#c5000b">
      <h6 class="tagline" style="Line-Height:22px; text-transform:uppercase">
        My impression of what they stood for crumbled. Instantly.</h6>
      </font>
      <div class="collapse" id="collapseIntegrity" aria-expanded="false">
        <p class="para">
          I singled out the framer and demanded to know if the frames we bought
          were from IKEA. Caught by surprise, he looked at the manager. Then
          claimed he wasn’t aware since it was the boss who got them. Meanwhile,
          my girlfriend looked up IKEA’s website and asked to reconfirm the size
          of the frame we paid for. The room went silent. Tension mounted as
          they saw us learn of the vast difference we overpaid.<br>
          <br>
          In a desperate attempt to contain the situation, the manager promptly
          volunteered to refund our payment for the frames. Which did little to
          placate my nerves. She later reflected the owner’s views, who
          justified that it was normal business practice to mark up items in
          order to cover operating expenses. Which I do <i>not</i> disagree. But
          that was never the point. In fact, <i>never</i> once did I mention I
          was overcharged or that I wanted my money back.

          <i>Why did the framer feel uncomfortable, possibly ashamed of admitting
          that the frames were from IKEA?<br>

          uncommon in Singapore and none was requested?</i>

        <p class="firstpara">
          THERE WAS NO dishonesty. No misrepresentation. No misconduct. Yet both
          clients and employees alike sensed that there was something larger at
          stake. What was it?

        </font>
        <br>
        <p class="para">
          Even though it was never explicitly stated, I was given, and they
          were conscious of giving, the <b>impression</b> of a premium product.
          And that state of being whole fell apart, <i>for everyone,</i> upon my
          unexpected discovery that the product was not premium.<br>
          <br>
          Integrity is subjective. Nevertheless, if the integrity of what you
          <a href="#StandFor" style="color:inherit">stand for</a> is betrayed,
          your employees and co-workers will find it hard to get behind what you
          truly stand for. More importantly, it leaves a bad taste in your
          client’s mouth. Regardless of the fact that business has been
          conducted legally and honestly, you've already lost that client.
